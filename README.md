# Australia Rainfall Analysis (Individual, academic)

This project analyzes a dataset of daily weather observations in Australia to explore patterns in rainfall and build predictive models. It applies multiple linear regression, stepwise selection (AIC), LASSO regularization, and Best Subset Selection.

## Technologies used
- R
- car, MASS, leaps, ggplot2, dplyr, glmnet

## Topics covered
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Feature selection and engineering
- Multiple linear regression modeling
- LASSO regularization
- Best Subset Selection
- Model diagnostics and evaluation (RMSE)
